## Hotel California

We as a team were tasked to develop a hotel reservation system. A general-use system that can be enabled to perform general basic front-desk activities of a hotel. Some of the basic functionalities include creating a new account for a new user, logging in to that account, viewing and editing the profile details, reserving a room in the hotel, viewing and writing reviews, and logging out of the account. The first thing a new user can see is the homepage of the system which includes some of the user reviews and some of the available services the hotel offers, and the options to login to an existing account or sign-up for a new one. We named our hotel, "Hotel California", in reference to the infamous 1976 Eagles song. 

To run this system, run the main.py file and it will give you a link which open to the homepage of our hotel. 

Enjoy and have a nice stay!

Team members include: Saadallah Itani, Lynn El Hariri, Mahmoud Yamani, and Jad Ghamloush.
